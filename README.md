# Luís Conceição

**AI Agent Engineer | MSc Business Intelligence**

I design and ship AI agents that connect natural-language interfaces to complex operational backends. My focus is on production systems — intent classification, structured command execution, multi-turn conversation management, and LLM orchestration with cost-aware routing.

## Featured: Source Check

A bilingual (EN/PT) fact-checking platform that verifies political claims against primary documents — official records, court filings, and government data. Every source is linked. No editorial opinion, just documents.

- Built with **Astro**, deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**
- Automated weekly newsletters via **Make.com** + **MailerLite** (RSS-driven campaign creation and scheduling)
- Bilingual RSS feeds, tag-based navigation, and evidence-image archiving

## What I Build

**Conversational AI Agents for Operations**
- Multi-step task execution through natural language (room assignments, report generation, data queries)
- Intent classification pipelines with confidence-based routing
- Modular service architectures: session management, command validation, knowledge retrieval
- Multilingual support with date/locale-aware parameter handling

**LLM Orchestration & RAG**
- Model routing across providers (OpenRouter, local models, Claude)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Chroma/FAISS over internal documentation
- Prompt engineering for structured JSON extraction from LLM responses
- Cost optimization: local models for classification, larger models for generation

**Report & Data Pipelines**
- Automated report execution with parameter resolution and PDF generation
- Caching strategies for API-heavy workflows
- Property-level analytics and strategic recommendations
