# Hi 👋, I’m Luís

I have a MSc in Business Intelligence and currently I design and ship AI agents that turn complex operational knowledge into actionable chat experiences.

## Current Projects
- 🧩 Building a multilingual agent stack with translation + regex-first logic + Llama 3.2 fallbacks so staff workflows stay fast, accurate, and privacy-friendly.
- 📊 Crafting a reporting agent that understands structured “record types,” multi-property comparisons, and cashbox-style summaries, then wraps them with “What / So What / Now What” advice.
- 🧭 Orchestrating group coordination and MCP/RAG tooling, including vector ingestion, knowledge-base docs, and Claude/OpenRouter connectors to keep the system grounded.

## Skills & Tools
- Python · FastAPI · Streamlit · Pydantic · pytest
- LangChain/MCP-style orchestration · Local LLMs (Llama 3.2) · Claude/OpenRouter integration
- RAG (Chroma/FAISS) · Prompt engineering · Translation layers

## Recent Wins
- Implemented new agents (Reporting + Group) with multi-property awareness and clearer insight summaries.
- Documented the end-to-end MCP/RAG workflow, testing playbooks, and troubleshooting guides for future collaborators.
- Built demo tooling (Streamlit + vector store + translation helpers) to validate the agent experience before production.

## Want to connect?
I’m happy to talk about prompt engineering, agent design, or building practical generative AI tooling—just send a note.
