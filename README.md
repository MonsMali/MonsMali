# Hi, I'm Luís

I have an MSc in Business Intelligence and I design and ship AI agents that turn complex operational knowledge into actionable chat experiences.

## Major Build (Private Work)

Built a production-oriented AI assistant that connects natural-language chat to a hospitality operations backend, supporting both read queries (guests, rooms, arrivals/departures, availability) and safe write actions (e.g., room assignment) through structured command execution with validation and error handling.

Designed a modular service architecture (session/context, intent classification, task routing, command execution client, and optional documentation RAG) to keep behavior predictable and maintainable as capabilities expand.

Implemented multilingual + date-aware querying (including relative dates and ISO week logic) and optimized intent classification to reduce token usage while preserving accuracy.

## Current Projects

- Building a multilingual agent stack with translation + regex-first logic + Llama 3.2 fallbacks so staff workflows stay fast, accurate, and privacy-friendly.
- Crafting a reporting agent that understands structured record types, multi-property comparisons, and cashbox-style summaries, then wraps them with "What / So What / Now What" advice.
- Orchestrating group coordination and MCP/RAG tooling, including vector ingestion, knowledge-base docs, and Claude/OpenRouter connectors to keep the system grounded.

## Recent Projects

- **Wheel of Luck (FITUR 2026)**: A lightweight event-ready "spin the wheel" style mini-app for interactive giveaways/engagement. [View Project](https://github.com/MonsMali/wheel-of-luck-FITUR2026)
- **CMO Quiz**: A quiz-style app for running a short interactive questionnaire/knowledge check experience. [View Project](https://github.com/MonsMali/cmo_quiz)
- **Bingo Família**: A simple bingo game/app for running a casual group bingo session. [View Project](https://github.com/MonsMali/bingo-familia)

## Skills & Tools

- Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, Pydantic, pytest
- LangChain/MCP-style orchestration, local LLMs (Llama 3.2), Claude/OpenRouter integration
- RAG (Chroma/FAISS), prompt engineering, translation layers

## Recent Wins

- Implemented new agents (Reporting + Group) with multi-property awareness and clearer insight summaries.
- Documented the end-to-end MCP/RAG workflow, testing playbooks, and troubleshooting guides for future collaborators.
- Built demo tooling (Streamlit + vector store + translation helpers) to validate the agent experience before production.
